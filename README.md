### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm 0J3, and I do code and sh\*t i guess?

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Yeetchat
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Node.JS
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 0J3#9971 on Discord or gh.contactme@wafflepowered.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Preferably either they/them, or she/her, but I don't care that much
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been coding since I was 5, joined github on my first account in 2016, and have a total of 629 local repos at the time of writing (and more non-local ones here). These repos count a total of 7GB of files (inclusive dependencies)
